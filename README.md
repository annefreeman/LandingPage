# Overview
I wanted a bit of direction while learning and a friend recommended the CS52 Full Stack Web Development Course at Dartmouth that has all assignments posted online. I started by following the *[Lab 1 Assignment](http://cs52.me/assignments/lab/landing-page/)*.

The goal of this project was to create a landing page for an imaginary website. I created a website for [Coffee Co.](https://annefreeman.github.io/LandingPage/) a website for a coffee company. The website is created with CSS and HTML (no javascript). 

## Process:
 I looked at some other websites for inspiration such as https://slack.com/, https://flourbakery.com/, and https://www.otherland.com/. From these websites I observed how they implemented the following elements and choose how to include these elements in my landing page:
* Responsive navBar
* Call to action button
* Large responsive image with text overlay
* Side by side elements
* Social links in footer
